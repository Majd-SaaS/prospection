## Add the extension to Chrome

This extension automatically clicks the "Follow" button on LinkedIn company pages.
It works best when combined with the automated company opener in the CLI utilities.

Steps:
- Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
- Enable **Developer mode**.
- Click **Load unpacked** and select the `chrome_plugin` folder from this repository.
- Confirm the installation.
